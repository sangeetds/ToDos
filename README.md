# ToDos

<q>Managing your todo's has never been this easy</q> - Not this webapp. 

A simple web app to manage your todos in one place. It is built with React.js, HTML and CSS while the backend is powered by GraphQL, Node.js and Express.js. 

You can have a look at the web app <a href="https://60148ecad7c90c00a98fc18d--competent-clarke-025478.netlify.app">here</a>.
